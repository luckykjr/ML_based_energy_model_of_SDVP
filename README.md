# ML-based energy model of a speed and displacement variable pump unit
Energy-saving hydraulic system is a topic in the automation industry. The low energy efficiency of electro-hydraulic systems is mainly caused by the poor flow rate matching. A speed and displacement variable pump (SDVP) is used to address this problem, but it is difficult to find the matched speed and displacement for the highest energy conversion efficiency of the SDVP due to the inaccuracy energy model and the challenge of coupling variables. This paper presents an energy-saving strategy integrated with machine learning and a genetic algorithm to handle this challenge. Relative variables of the machine learning model are picked through analysis of the mathematical energy model, and the usage of machine learning can fit the high-nonlinear energy model caused by uncertainties in both components and environmental factors.
For explaining the optimum prediction performance of the XGBoost-based power model of the SDVP, three common ML algorithms (support vector regression (SVR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF)) are also be utilized to build the power prediction model. these four kinds of input power models are established based on 5-fold cross-validation.
Only partial data is provided in this example, due to the confidentiality of the data.
